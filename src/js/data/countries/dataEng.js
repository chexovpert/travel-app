      'The climate in Italy is predominantly Mediterranean, but this does not mean that the weather is the same in all its regions. In the interior of the country and in the northern regions, features of a temperate climate are manifested. It is warming from north to south. The climatic features of the regions are determined by two factors: the influence of the Mediterranean Sea and the Alps, since the mountains are a natural barrier to the winds blowing from the west and north. Summer in Italy is hot and dry (from +24 to +34 ° С), winters on the coast in the center of the country are mild, in the north it is colder by 7-12 degrees. Precipitation is unevenly distributed across regions: in the vicinity of the Alps, up to 1200 mm a year, including heavy snowfalls in winter. In the center of the country, on average, up to 750 mm falls, and a significant part of them falls on winter rains. In the south, the climate is drier, the amount of precipitation is within 500 mm. '

This length from north to south makes the climate of Thailand one of the most diverse in Southeast Asia. The southwest monsoon brings rain and relative coolness in late May - mid-July.
